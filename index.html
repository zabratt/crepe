            <li style="font-family: cursive;"> this will take 15 munites from your time </li>
         </ol>
         <p style="font-family: cursive;">To make delicious crepes, begin by combining half a cup of milk, half a cup of water, and one cup of
             all-purpose flour in a mixing bowl. Whisk these ingredients together until the batter is smooth and
            free of lumps. Next, add two tablespoons of melted butter to the mixture, stirring well
            to incorporate. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and lightly grease it with a bit
            of butter or oil. Pour a small amount of batter into the pan, tilting it to spread the
            batter evenly and thinly across the surface. Cook the crepe for about one to two minutes,
            or until the edges start to lift and the bottom turns golden brown. Flip the crepe and cook
            for another minute. Repeat this process with the remaining batter. Serve your crepes warm with your favorite fillings or toppings.</p>
